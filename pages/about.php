			<p class="statement">The suburban alcoholic foundation was established by the Suburban (Northland) group in 1955 and "Owner and Landlord" of the premises and equipment. The SAF is a nonprofit corporation operated by a board of trustees and it is an entirely separate entity. Operation of the premises, in line with AA traditions, is conducted by a special worker employed as the Manager. Since the Manager is also a member of the group, he/she is ever mindful of the group conscience.
					<br><br>
Experience has taught us that the successful operation of the Premises depends to a large extent upon monies received from the Foundation Members. Each new member of the group shall be given a copy of our brochure. The Manager will always be available to inform group members or the groups' Secretary of the need for Foundation Membership and support.
<br><br>
The purpose of the Foundation is to help the sick alcoholic recover if he so desires. Any sober member of the Northland Group may join the Foundation for the monthly contribution currently in effect.</p>
