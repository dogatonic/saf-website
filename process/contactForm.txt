Message: This email is to inform you that the Free 1-Year subscription of the Security certificate (HTTPS) on your website has expired. This means that hackers can now snoop in on your website easily. Online viruses, bad actors or competitors can hijack your confidential personal information as well as your customers' individual data for bad practices. 

Moreover, an invalid or expired SSL certificate also infringes GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation; effective May 25, 2018). Article 32 of GDPR requires that regulated data must be protected with appropriate technical and organizational measures, including concealment of personal data and the capability to make sure the ongoing privacy of systems and services. 

Due to this, Google has also started to mark all incoming connections to your website as "insecure". You can check this by looking at the security status (to the left of the web address) of your website in any web browser. You will notice that there is no Green PADLOCK visible next to your web address. 

To resolve this, you are required to re-deploy an Security certificate on your website now: https://esslcerts.com/saffoundation.com/a/1639477447/v0 

This will conceal data and secure all connections on your website. The digital SSL certificate will be mailed to you within minutes after verification. 

WARNING: Your website may stop running securely within 72 hours if it is flagged as a malicious website, due to hosting insecure content. For further information see part 3.1.9 of our service level agreement. We can not be held accountable for any financial or technical losses resulting from this.
